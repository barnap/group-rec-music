              Thanks for your participation in our experiment.
          </h5>
          <h5>
              The aim of this research is to assess whether the satisfaction of listening to a particular song is influenced
              by the presence of a second person and the knowledge of his/her ratings. We intend to determine whether
              there are certain types of people who are more likely to be influenced and differently appreciate a song
              in such a context, in relation to their personality and the type of relationship they have with their travelling
              companion.
          </h5>
          <h5>
              In case you need more information about our experiment, please feel free to contact us.

              We would also like to remind you that you now have 30 days to request the removal of your data.
              At the end of this period, the collected email addresses and nicknames will be deleted by completely
              anonymising the data. It will no longer be possible to trace the data entered by each participant.
              To request deletion of your data please contact us.
          </h5>

              Finally, we would like to remind you that the winner of a 20 euro Amazon voucher will be drawn in the next
              few days.
          </h5>
          <h5>
              Thank you again for your kind collaboration.
